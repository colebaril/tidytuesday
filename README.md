# TidyTuesday Visualizations

This repository contains my weekly contributions to the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, a community data initiative that encourages practicing data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling in R.

## Contents
- Weekly folders with code (`.R` or `.Rmd`) and outputs (`.png`, `.pdf`, etc.)
- Visualizations created primarily with **ggplot2** and the **tidyverse**
- Occasional use of additional packages for data cleaning, annotation, and styling

## Goals
- Improve and practice data visualization skills
- Explore new datasets every week
- Share reproducible examples for others to learn from

## Example
![Example Plot](https://github.com/colebaril/tidytuesday/blob/main/2025-09-02%20-%20Australian%20Frogs/ustralian%20Frog%20Species%20Richness.png) <!-- Replace with one of your plots -->

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colebaril/tidytuesday.git

2. Open the R scripts for each week.

3. Run the code to reproduce the visualizations.
