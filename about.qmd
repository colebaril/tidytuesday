Welcome to my **TidyTuesday Gallery**!   

Each week, I explore a new dataset from the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), creating visualizations and summaries using **R** and **tidyverse tools**. This site serves as a personal record of my weekly explorations, as well as a way to share the insights and graphics I produce with others.

All datasets are publicly available via the TidyTuesday GitHub repository, and this project is **entirely open source**. You can find the original TidyTuesday datasets here:  

- [TidyTuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)  
- [`tidytuesdayR` package](https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR) for easy dataset access in R

This site itself is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and the full source code for the website is available here:
