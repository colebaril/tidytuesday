## Explicit Songs

A fairly basic viz this week, but was curious as to whether the number of songs classified as explicit has increased, and sure enough it has. 
```{r, plot}
billboard |> 
  mutate(year = year(date)) |> 
  filter(year != "2025") |> 
  reframe(prop_explicit = mean(explicit),
          .by = year) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop_explicit)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Proportion Explicit",
       x = "Year",
       title = "Proportion of Explicit Billboard Hot 100 Number One Songs") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 15)
```
